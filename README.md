# About This Organization

This is an organization for students in Thornton Middle School to make friends, make repositories anything related to thornton, etc. If you have a great idea for a repository and/or do a large part of one, you can add your name its credits! If you are looking for someone to collaborate with on a new project, check the members page. No one is expected to do something; working on a project is completely optional and is something you can just do in your spare time. 


## We are always looking for people to join and help the Thornton Community! Spread the word and invite people to join this organization!
