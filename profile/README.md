# About This Organization

This is an organization for students in Thornton Middle School to make friends, make repositories about anything related to thornton, etc. If you have a great idea for a repository and/or work on a large part of one, you can add your name to its credits! If you are looking for someone to collaborate with on a new project, check the members page. No one is expected to do something; working on a project is completely optional and is something you can just do in your spare time. 

## We are always looking for people to join and help the Thornton Community! Spread the word and invite people to join this organization! Any help is appreciated greatly!



### Rules & Policies
1. No cyberbullying in code comments, issue pages, pr requests, conversations, discussions, and any other way to communicate.
2. Messages here cannot be taken to start bullying in-person (e.g. at school) or online (e.g. a group chat).
3. You cannot use projects in this organization to circumvent school policies. Nor can a project's purpose be to do so. One example of such violation is a project that lets you bypass payments, such as new IDs or socials.

**Please report any violation of these rules ASAP to a trustable member of this organization and we will try to get things sorted. Report to school staff only if things escalate too far and out of control.**
