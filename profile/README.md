# About This Organization

This is an organization for students in Thornton Middle School to make friends, make repositories about literally anything (some repositories may be helpful to some students too). If you have a great idea for a repository and/or work on a large part of one, you can add your name to its credits! If you are looking for someone to collaborate with on a new project, check the members page. No one is expected to do something; working on a project is completely optional and is something you can just do in your spare time. 

## We are always looking for people to join and help the Thornton Community! Spread the word and invite people to join this organization! Any help is appreciated greatly!



### Rules & Policies
1. No cyberbullying in code comments, issue pages, pr requests, conversations, discussions, and any other way to communicate.
2. Messages here cannot be taken to start bullying in-person (e.g. at school) or online (e.g. a group chat).
3. You cannot use projects in this organization to circumvent school policies. Nor can a project allow that. One example of such violation is a project that lets you bypass payments, such as new IDs or socials.
4. Nothing is stopping you from doing projects individually or collaborating with another person in this organization for learning purposes, etc. However, if the project is owned by this organization (i.e. in the Repositories section of this organization), it should follow the above rules.

**Please report any violation of these rules ASAP to a trustable member of this organization and we will try to get things sorted.**
